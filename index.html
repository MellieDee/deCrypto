        Crypto is short for “cryptocurrency.” Basically, a virtual alternative to government issued money that is meant
        for secure, peer-to-peer internet transactions.</p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Similar to exchanging one type of money, say dollars for euros at a bank or money exchange kiosk, you can
        exchange dollars for - or “buy” - cryptocurrency “coins” or fractions of coins on the internet and hold them in
        a digital wallet. Digital currencies are becoming more mainstream. Stores like Whole Foods are beginning to
        accept crypto as payment and some cryptocurrencies like Crypto.com offer VisaTM cards.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Bitcoin, the original, and Ethereum are two of the biggest more recognizable names, but there are thousands of
        different cryptocurrencies put into circulation by private entities, the values of which are determined by their
        internet users. Any particular coin is worth what someone is willing to pay for it at any given moment in time.
        For many, they are an alternative investment. Like stocks, they are considered assets for accounting purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Also like stocks, they can be a risky investment! Learn all you can, then decide if crypto is right for you.</p>

        <h3 class="text-purple-900 font-extrabold text-2xl p-2">What is blockchain technology?</h3>
        <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
          All cryptocurrency transactions are stored in groups - or “blocks. When a block is full, it is closed then
          linked - or chained - to the previously filled block using cryptography. This process creates a timeline of
          transactional events and data that cannot be altered. In the case of cryptocurrency, this unchangeable
          electronic ledger is open to other cryptocurrency users and stored on computers within that currency’s network
          - anyone who uses that particular coin has a copy of this digital journal. The accuracy of these transactions
          is consistently being verified by this enormous amount of computing power. It is this confirmed, immutable
          list that enables secure transactions to be made without using a bank or other verifier. In this way there is
          no centralized ‘keeper of the books’. Instead, all users control all of the data.
        </p>

        What is Crypto Mining?
        To prevent fraud, each cryptocurrency transaction is verified. The Proof of Work verification method, sends a
        math problem to computers to solve. Each computer - or “miner” - races to solve the puzzle. The first one that
        does is rewarded with a bit of cryptocurrency. The amount of computing power, not to mention electricity needed
        to work on and solve these puzzles is incredible, so often these “winners” just about break-even. After the
        individual verifies the transaction, it is still checked and then approved by a majority (51%) of the ledger
        holders before it is added to the chain. (Different cryptocurrencies use different methods to verify their
        transactions.)
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        How is Crypto different from using Paypal, using Google Pay or performing an electronic funds transfer at my
        bank?
        PayPal, Google Pay, various other payment apps and banks depend on the traditional financial system to conduct
        transactions. They ask for permission to transfer currency in its electronic form. At your bank, you could go to
        the ATM and turn this existing digital representation of money into its physical representation -- dollar bills.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Cryptocurrency trading happens peer-to-peer; third parties do not have to ask permission. Generally speaking,
        there is not a physical representation of cryptocurrency; it’s purely electronic computer code. Lastly, unlike
        money sitting in your bank, it doesn’t have the backing or protections that government-issued currency has.(FDIC
        Link here?)
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Is it real money?
        Well. That depends. What is your definition of “real” money? Cryptocurrencies have value and can be exchanged,
        and for the most part, many cryptocurrencies do not represent physically tangible assets like gold or oil.
        However, some cryptocurrencies are minting physical coins with verifiable values stored on the blockchain and
        others are pegged to the value of fiat money (money issued by a government and ‘backed’ by that government
        instead of a physical commodity like silver).

        According to Investopedia, in their article <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money.asp">“Money”</a>
        updated February 4, 2021, reviewed by Charles Potters, and fact checked by Yarilet Perez, “In order to be most
        useful as money, a currency should be: 1) fungible, 2) durable, 3) portable, 4) recognizable, and 5) stable.”
        Many cryptocurrencies aim to adhere to these tenets, however some critics feel there is an argument to be made
        that cryptocurrency is too volatile to meet the stable requirement.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Where can I buy cryptocurrencies?
        Many traditional investment platforms and brokers like Schwab, and Fidelity are adding crypto to their
        investment line-ups. There are also crypto only exchanges like Coinbase.com, and crypto banks, like Vast.bank.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Can I turn Crypto into Cash?
        Check with the exchange or investment platform you are using for selling instructions. Some websites allow you
        to sell and apply the proceeds to prepaid debit cards.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Is Cryptocurrency safe?
        Generally speaking transactions and user data are encrypted. However, as a currency, it doesn’t have the backing
        or protections that government issued currency has. So, if a cryptocurrency company goes under, the government
        does not cover the loss. In other words crypto is not federally insured. It is also susceptible to fluctuating
        exchange rates, higher exchange fees and fraud.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-purple-900 p-2">
        Is Cryptocurrency legal in the USA?
        According to Decoding Crypto: Are there regulations in the US for Cryptocurrency on nasdaq.com by John Hyatt, on
        Aug 19, 2021, cryptocurrencies do not fit perfectly wrapped with little bows in the US regulatory frameworks,
        but they are recognized. Securities and Exchange commission will apply SEC regulations, Commodities Futures
        Trading Commission classified some cryptocurrencies as commodities with some derivatives like futures, traded on
        public exchanges, and the Treasury department created a Tax Plan with reference to cryptocurrency.
